Why am I writting this? It's not like I'm doing an innovative project that world is yet to see <img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/245/default/light/1.0">

## My first time making a game
Trying out pygame, i'm more than sure that coding could be done better >_<

***Is done!***

## Updates

### Playable already, just start game.py via python (pygame required ofc)
Also optimised a lot, especially compared to version in the main branch lol

### Restart and mode choosing features
I hope it'll work well

### Some design changes
Added a bozo just for him to be there <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/932792945059459122.webp?size=32&amp;quality=lossless">

### Added .exe file
Now can be started without python neither pygame(fake news, trying to do this), I think this is the end, the game is done

## P. S. (Author's note lol)
### Turns out having all code in one file is more effective
Or maybe the problem is that i don't really know much about how pygame works.

And also despite all my thoughts about how great i optimised the game, this shit is still takes some visible part of PC's resources.

There is too much code written, I wonder if it cuz I'm not expirienced or it actually requires so much. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/915670770611552276.webp?size=32&amp;quality=lossless">
