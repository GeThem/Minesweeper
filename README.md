Why am I writting this? It's not like I'm doing an innovative project that world is yet to see <img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/245/default/light/1.0">

## My first time making a game
Trying out pygame, i'm more than sure that coding could be done better >_<

Not done yet, ***BUT!***

## Updates:

### Playable already, just start game.py via python (pygame required ofc)
Also optimised a lot, especially compared to version in the main branch lol

### Restart and mode choosing features
I hope it'll work well


## P. S.
### Turns out having all code in one file is more effective
Or maybe the problem is that i don't really know much about how pygame works.

And also despite all my thoughts about how great i optimised the game, this shit is still takes some visible part of PC's resources.
